  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m still having major issues with ServiceMix. The ServiceMix instances will not connect to each other at all. I&#8217;ve tried everything I can find to configure ActiveMQ to allow message passing between them, but nothing has come of it yet. There are a few tcp connections between the two instances that I can see with netstat, but it doesn&#8217;t show up in jconsole. It has to be an issue with connecting ActiveMQ instances on separate machines, as it seems to work just fine when the ServiceMix instances are both on the same machine. Another puzzling aspect is that the cluster example that ships with ServiceMix works fine across machines, but if I hot deploy components to it instead of using static deployment then they cannot be seen by the other ServiceMix instance. I may have to re-write the config for my application to a static deployment, but I would like to know how to get it working dynamically. This should keep me busy for the week.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve spent most of today trying to discover why my ServiceMix tutorial application won&#8217;t work when I split the service units across multiple ServiceMix instances. Although I have specified that I am using the JMS message flow and the ActiveMQ brokers seem to be talking, the messages are not getting delivered. The message sent into the HTTP BC just gives back an exception about not being able to write a non xml fault to a non soap request. I have eliminated the virtual machines as the source of the error - this happens between instances running on separate windows machines within our home LAN as well. I have made sure that it is possible to have ServiceMix instances auto-discover each other by running the Cluster example on two separate machines. I have also checked that the Cluster example works between virtual machines. I can only assume that there is a problem in how ServiceMix is set up by default - something I will have to check by trying to create a simple example that is deployed rather than uses a stand-alone ServiceMix instance. Another option is to upgrade to the latest version of ServiceMix and see if they have changed the configuration (I didn&#8217;t want to upgrade as I&#8217;ve written and tested the tutorial on 3.1.2).</p>
